## Overview
For this project, I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for solving the maze. This maze can be randomly generated, or you righht click to start thhe maze solving process.

## How to

`Right-click` - To stop from tracking the mouse to leave the algorithm in place \
`Left-click`  - To start the algorithm and drag your mouse to see the different possibilities this algorithm may use \
`Middle-click` - To clear the maze, and re-generate a new maze. \
`Click Escape` - To exit the window
