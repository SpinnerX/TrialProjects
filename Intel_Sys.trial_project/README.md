## Overview
For the SJSU Robotics Intelligent Systems trial project, I implemented the pathfinder Dijkstra's algorithm to help solve a maze. Which allows users to drag the mouse to see the different kinds of ways the maze could be solved.

## Resourceful Links
`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KiCBXu4P-2Y&t=286s&ab_channel=WilliamFiset` - used this YouTube to help with the maze generator, as that be quite tricky. 

## How to

`Right-click` - To stop from tracking the mouse to leave the algorithm in place \
`Left-click`  - To start the algorithm and drag your mouse to see the different possibilities this algorithm may use \
`Middle-click` - To clear the maze, and re-generate a new maze. \
`Click Escape` - To exit the window
