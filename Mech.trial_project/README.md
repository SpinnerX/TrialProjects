## Overview
This is the SJSU Robotics Mechanical trial project. The objective is to design a gimbal, including sketching, CAD, and critically analyzing different environmental edge cases the gimbal may occur
Simulating if this gimbal was to be mounted on a rover in the middle of either unknown terrain or other unknown factors that may cause the gimbal to prove to be unable to operate

## Resourceful Links
These links here are what is used for research, components, design standards search, environmental cases, and understanding the requirements necessary when designing a gimbal

- this URL redirects you to a website that teaches you about component sets that are involved in a rover, useful for learning about how gimbals are mounted onto the rover. Such as a servo gimbal, that can stabilize a gimbal up to 3-axis, using the ArduPilot.
